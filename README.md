# RLDV

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and a Grasshopper canvas that have been written to implement the Robotized Laser Doppler Vibrometer setup.

In order to run the scripts, the following third-party softwares are required:

- MATLAB version 2016 or later, with Signal Acquisition and Signal Processing toolboxes
- Rhinoceros 3d version 5 or later with the Grassopper plug-in
- HAL 5 plug-in for Grasshopper

As this is a research code, no manual is provided and potential users need a good understanding of the mechanics of involved softwares. The documentation is limited to the comments contained in the different pieces of code.

For any question regarding the setup, feel free to send an email to: pierre.margerit@enpc.fr
